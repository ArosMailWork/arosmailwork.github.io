Hi, its nice to see u interest about me and click here

Im a Vietnamese Indie game developer, who got trapped with the charm of graphic programming (even its painfully hard)
I love to do stuffs that mixed between tech and graphic which also one of the most important aspect of game

This blog will have post about some cool tech art that I discovered by myself, sometime maybe have low level programming with game engine too

making game is pain, but passion, right ?
